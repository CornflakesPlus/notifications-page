## My process

- Finding a challenge on FEM
- Brain storming ideas for added functionality and more challenge
- created a three section MockUp for dynamic DOM manupilation
- used VSC for coding

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Learned major DOM manupilation by trying to make the UI as dynamic and live as possible. Used heavy debugging for wired bugs and behaviour such as the innerHTML.

Learned how to troubleshoot independently while keeping up with the timeline. Learned color themes, pallettes and colo theory to beautify the the visuals.

Learned to stay relaxed and able to find solutions independently when stuck in a dark well.

### Continued development

- Major bug fixes
